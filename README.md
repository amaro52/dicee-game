# dicee-game
A simple randomized dice game. The dice with the higher value wins.

## Abut
I used simple HTML/CSS to display the dice and the title, and JavaScript to manipulate the DOM in order to display different dice values and the winner. Just refresh the page and the values will change. The point of this project is to gain practice and experience in interacting and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM).
